            <h3>What makes badminton more fun for me</h3>
            <p>
                What makes badminton more fun for me is the thrill of every rally — that quick back-and-forth that keeps my heart racing and my mind sharp. I love how it's both competitive and playful, letting me laugh with friends one moment and dive for a perfect shot the next. Every game feels fresh, unpredictable, and full of energy.

            <h3>How it started</h3>
            <p>
                I started playing badminton back in my college days. After a long week of classes, the weekends were my escape, and I would join my friends for a few fun matches to relieve stress. Over time, it became a daily habit — now I make sure to spend at least an hour each day on the court to stay active and stress-free.

            <h3>What motivates me</h3>
            <p>
                Playing badminton motivates me in so many ways. It keeps me fit and healthy, strengthening my muscles and improving my agility. It's a great way to release stress and calm my mind after a busy day. Each match also sharpens my focus, which helps me stay more attentive and productive in other areas of life. Overall, it's a fun way to balance fitness, mental clarity, and energy.
